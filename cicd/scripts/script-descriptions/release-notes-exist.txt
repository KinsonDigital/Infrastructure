Script Description:

This script is used for checking that production or preview release notes exist.  If the 'Release Type' argument
is a non-case-sensitive value of 'production', then it will check for production release notes.  If the 'Release Type'
argument is a non-case-sensitive value of 'preview', then it will check for preview release notes.

The script takes the following 5 arguments:

1. Release Type - The type of release.  Acceptable values are 'Production' or 'Preview' and are not case-sensitive.
2. Version - The release version.  The first character of the version can start with or without the letter 'v'.
