Script Description:

This script is used for validating release notes for a release.  It will check if all of the issues in
a milestone that matches the 'version' argument exist in the release notes.  If a PR label is provided,
it will check if pull requests in the milestone contain the label and then check if the pull request link
is in the release notes.

The script takes the following 5 arguments:

1. Project name - The name of the project
2. Release type - The type of release.  Acceptable values are 'Production' or 'Preview' and are not case-sensitive.
3. Version - The release version.  The first character of the version can start with or without the letter 'v'.
4. PR label (optional) - The label of any PRs that must be in the notes.  If no label
   is provided, then the script will not check if any PRs are in the notes.
5. GitHub token (optional) - This script does not change any GitHub data so a token is not required.
   It is recommended that you provide a token.  If a token is not provided, then it is subject to rate limits.
