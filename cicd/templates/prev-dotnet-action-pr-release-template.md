### Additional Information:

**_<details closed><summary>Unit Tests</summary>_**

Reasons for local unit test execution:
- Unit tests might pass locally but not in the CI environment during the status check process or vice-versa.
- Tests might pass on the developer's machine but not necessarily on the code reviewer's machine.

**_<details closed><summary>Version Updating</summary>_**

The version can be updated by setting the values of the `<Version/>` and `<FileVersion/>` XML tags in the project file.
The `<Version/>` and `<FileVersion/>` values can hold the preview release version.
The `<AssemblyVersion/>` XML tag can only hold production values.  Preview values are not allowed.
